## Introduction

Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention for their powerful generative capabilities, particularly in the fields of chemistry and materials science. In this blog post, we review two recent contributions leveraging diffusion models for distinct yet related problems: **optimal adsorbate placement** and **data-efficient molecular generation**.

## Adsorbate Placement via Conditional Denoising Diffusion (AdsorbDiff)

### Problem Statement

In heterogeneous catalysis, accurately determining the optimal adsorbate placement on catalytic slabs (adslab configurations) is crucial for discovering effective new catalysts. Traditionally, finding these optimal placements involves:

* Initial heuristic or random placement of the adsorbate molecule.
* Subsequent optimization with computationally expensive quantum mechanical methods such as **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** to determine the lowest energy configuration.

This conventional approach has significant limitations:

* **Computational inefficiency**: Evaluating numerous potential sites individually through DFT is prohibitively expensive.
* **Heuristic limitations**: Reliance on heuristics may miss global optima due to insufficient exploration of configuration space.
* **Brute-force inefficiencies**: Exhaustively sampling numerous adsorbate configurations is computationally intensive and impractical.

Thus, a more efficient and systematic method for adsorbate placement is critically needed.

### Motivation: What does AdsorbDiff Aim to Tackle?

The **AdsorbDiff** paper introduces a conditional denoising diffusion framework designed explicitly to tackle these limitations. The key motivation behind **AdsorbDiff** is to leverage recent advancements in diffusion-based generative models, which have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and accuracy across various domains, particularly molecular and material sciences.

Specifically, **AdsorbDiff** aims to:

* Accurately predict optimal adsorbate sites and orientations.
* Significantly reduce the computational overhead of searching for global minima.
* Fully utilize existing computational data through conditional training.

This framework capitalizes on recent successes in generative modeling and machine learning force fields (MLFFs) to accelerate catalytic discovery.

### Method Overview

The **AdsorbDiff** method integrates a novel diffusion-based generative model with ML-driven optimizations in a systematic workflow:

**1. Conditional Diffusion Modeling**

*	**Translation and Rotation Modeling:**
AdsorbDiff defines a diffusion process over the manifold of 2D translations and 3D rigid rotations of an adsorbate relative to the slab, explicitly considering periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The diffusion model iteratively updates the adsorbate’s position and orientation toward energetically favorable states.

* **Conditional Training:**
The diffusion training is conditioned on relative energies (differences from the lowest-energy configurations), significantly enhancing training efficiency and effectiveness compared to naive unconditional training.

* **Score Matching and Reverse Diffusion:**
AdsorbDiff employs a score-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model, where the model learns to approximate gradients of the probability density of optimal configurations. This technique allows systematic sampling toward lower-energy states from initially randomized placements.

1. ML Force Field Optimization

*	After obtaining predictions from the diffusion model, **AdsorbDiff** performs rapid local optimizations using ML force fields trained on large DFT-derived datasets. This step refines the predicted positions, drastically reducing computational costs while maintaining near-DFT accuracy.

2. Final Verification

*	A single-point DFT verification evaluates the accuracy of optimized configurations, ensuring reliability and consistency with rigorous quantum mechanical benchmarks.

### Experimental Results

Experiments were conducted using the OC20-Dense dataset, extensively benchmarked and widely recognized in computational catalysis research. Key results demonstrating **AdsorbDiff**’s effectiveness include:

* **Improved Success Rate**:
AdsorbDiff achieved a 31.8% success rate in identifying configurations within 0.1 eV of the DFT benchmark, significantly outperforming the naive random baseline (9.1%) and unconditional diffusion baseline (11.4%).

* **Efficiency in Computational Cost**:
AdsorbDiff matched the accuracy achieved by baseline methods that required evaluating multiple (5x more) random placements, highlighting substantial computational savings.

* **Generalization Capability**:
Evaluations demonstrated robust generalization to unseen adsorbate-slab systems (out-of-distribution scenarios), underscoring the model’s practical utility for novel catalyst discovery tasks.

* **Impact of Pre-training and Architecture Choices**:
Experiments confirmed that conditional diffusion significantly benefits from extensive pre-training on diverse local optimization data. Moreover, AdsorbDiff exhibited insensitivity to different GNN architectures during diffusion training, simplifying architecture selection compared to traditional ML force field models.

### Summary of Contributions:

* Developed **AdsorbDiff**, a novel conditional diffusion framework for efficiently predicting optimal adsorbate placements.
* Demonstrated substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency over traditional heuristic and brute-force methods.
* Showed robust generalization and practical viability through rigorous benchmarking on the OC20-Dense dataset.

Overall, **AdsorbDiff** provides an innovative solution addressing longstanding computational bottlenecks in catalytic materials discovery.

## Data-Efficient Molecular Generation with Hierarchical Textual Inversion (HI-Mol)

### Problem Statement

Molecular generation tasks, especially in domains such as drug discovery, often face significant challenges due to the inherent scarcity of molecular data. Traditional deep generative models, although powerful, typically rely on extensive training data to effectively learn and generalize molecular distributions. This reliance poses critical limitations:

* **Data scarcity** : High-quality, task-specific molecular data is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to obtain due to rigorous experimental processes.
* **Limited generalization** : Existing models struggle significantly when trained on limited datasets, resulting in poor-quality or chemically invalid generated molecules.
* **Reduced practical applicability** : Real-world applications often involve niche tasks (e.g., specific drug targets), further exacerbating data scarcity issues and limiting practical deployments.

Thus, developing a robust and data-efficient molecular generation framework is crucial for addressing real-world chemical and pharmaceutical challenges.

### Motivation: What does HI-Mol Aim to Tackle?

The **HI-Mol** paper directly addresses these limitations by introducing a novel method that significantly enhances data efficiency in molecular generation. The motivation behind HI-Mol is derived from two key insights:

* **Hierarchical structure of molecular data** : Chemically meaningful information can be naturally represented in hierarchical forms, capturing coarse-grained (general) and fine-grained (specific) molecular characteristics.
* **Success of textual inversion in the visual domain** : Textual inversion has shown remarkable capability to learn meaningful representations from very limited examples, inspiring its adaptation to molecular data.

The paper proposes leveraging these insights to construct an efficient generative framework capable of producing high-quality molecules even from minimal datasets.

### Method Overview

**HI-Mol** introduces Hierarchical Textual Inversion, a novel molecular generation framework composed of two main components:

**1. Hierarchical Token Embeddings**

*	**Multi-level representation** : Molecules are represented using hierarchical embeddings, comprising:
  * **Shared tokens**: Capture general chemical features common across molecules.
  * **Intermediate tokens**: Capture cluster-specific or group-level chemical information.
  * **Detail tokens**: Represent individual molecule-specific features.

These multi-level embeddings effectively capture the hierarchical nature of molecular distributions, allowing the model to leverage both general and specific molecular characteristics effectively.

**2. Embedding Interpolation-based Sampling**

*	After hierarchical token embeddings are learned, HI-Mol generates new molecules by interpolating these learned embeddings. This interpolation leverages learned chemical semantics extensively, allowing diverse yet chemically valid molecule generation from limited examples.
*	Specifically, novel molecules are generated by sampling interpolation points between embeddings at different hierarchical levels, effectively synthesizing new chemical entities that blend known chemical features.

### Experimental Results

Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superior data efficiency of **HI-Mol**:

* **Quantitative results**:
  * On standard benchmarks such as MoleculeNet (e.g., HIV, BBBP, BACE datasets), HI-Mol outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in metrics like Frechet ChemNet Distance (FCD), Neighborhood Subgraph Pairwise Distance Kernel (NSPDK), and the ratio of chemically active generated molecules.
  * For instance, on the HIV dataset, HI-Mol achieved a significant improvement in FCD scores (20.2 → 16.6) compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

* **Remarkable data efficiency**:
  * Evaluations on the widely-used QM9 dataset demonstrated that HI-Mol significantly surpassed existing models (e.g., STGG) using only 2% of the data, highlighting substantial gains in data efficiency (FCD: 0.585 → 0.430 with only 2% data).
  * Performance improved further with modest increases in training data (FCD: 0.430 → 0.398 with 10% data), consistently maintaining high novelty and chemical validity.

* **Practical applicability in property prediction tasks**:
  * Molecules generated by HI-Mol significantly improved low-shot molecular property prediction tasks, demonstrating practical utility and effectiveness in realistic chemical applications.

### Summary of Contributions:

* Developed **HI-Mol**, a novel molecular generation method leveraging hierarchical textual inversion adapted from textual inversion methods in the visual domain.
* Achieved substantial improvements in data efficiency, producing chemically valid and diverse molecules even from minimal training data.
* Demonstrated strong practical performance improvements on various standard benchmarks and downstream tasks in molecular property prediction.

Overall, **HI-Mol** significantly advances molecular generation capabilities, particularly for real-world applications faced with limited molecular data resources.


## Common Themes and Complementary Strengths

Although **AdsorbDiff** and **HI-Mol** address distinct challenges in chemistry and materials science—namely optimal adsorbate placement and data-efficient molecular generation—they share several crucial themes and complementary strengths:

* **Robustness of Diffusion Models**:
Both methods rely on the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models. Diffusion models have recently become the state-of-the-art approach for complex generative tasks due to their ability to efficiently explore and represent intricate, high-dimensional chemical spaces. In particular, these models excel at generating chemically valid and physically meaningful configurations, overcoming traditional sampling inefficiencies.

* **Conditional Diffusion Techniques**:
Each framework incorporates conditional diffusion approaches to significantly improve model training and data utilization. AdsorbDiff explicitly conditions diffusion on relative energy differences, thereby leveraging energy landscapes directly and efficiently guiding the model towards optimal configurations. Similarly, HI-Mol introduces hierarchical textual inversion, conditioning diffusion on hierarchical embeddings that represent molecules at multiple granularities, facilitating high-quality molecule generation even with limited training data.

* **Data Efficiency and Computational Savings**:
Both approaches drastically reduce computational costs and data requirements compared to traditional methods. AdsorbDiff significantly diminishes reliance on computationally expensive quantum mechanical methods (DFT) through intelligent predictive modeling and rapid machine learning-driven refinements. HI-Mol achieves remarkable efficiency by using learned hierarchical embeddings, enabling substantial improvements in chemical generation tasks with significantly less data (e.g., achieving state-of-the-art results using merely 2% to 10% of traditional dataset sizes).

* **Practical Applicability**:
AdsorbDiff’s advancements directly benefit catalyst discovery and materials science by quickly and accurately identifying optimal adsorbate configurations, a fundamental bottleneck in catalyst development. HI-Mol’s methodology significantly enhances practical drug discovery processes by providing a robust framework for generating novel molecular structures under data-scarce conditions, a common scenario in pharmaceutical research.

Collectively, these strengths highlight how modern generative modeling techniques, particularly conditional diffusion models, can broadly transform computational chemistry, bringing substantial practical benefits across diverse chemical domains.

## Future Directions and Implications

The successful application of diffusion-based models like **AdsorbDiff** and **HI-Mol** indicates several promising avenues for future research and broader implications for the field of computational chemistry:

* **Integrated Computational Frameworks**:
An exciting future direction involves creating integrated computational pipelines that seamlessly combine molecular generation (e.g., HI-Mol) with adsorbate placement and optimization (e.g., AdsorbDiff). Such an integrated approach could streamline processes from candidate molecule synthesis directly through to their functional deployment in catalytic applications, enabling end-to-end automated catalyst discovery and optimization.

* **Complex Chemical and Biological Systems**:
Extending these techniques to tackle increasingly complex and realistic chemical environments—such as multicomponent catalytic systems, complex surfaces, and biomolecular structures—is another promising research direction. Advanced diffusion models adapted to these complex systems could significantly expand our capability to predict, design, and optimize advanced materials, drugs, and biocatalysts.

* **Enhanced Generalizability and Robustness**:
Further improving generalizability through better training strategies, broader dataset coverage, and more sophisticated conditional structures could enhance the robustness of diffusion models, making them more universally applicable across various chemical and material design tasks.

* **Real-Time and Interactive Applications**:
Leveraging these computational efficiencies might enable real-time or interactive platforms for researchers, significantly accelerating exploratory research and design cycles in material science and pharmaceutical chemistry.

## Conclusion
