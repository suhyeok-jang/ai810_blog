## Introduction

Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention for their powerful generative capabilities, particularly in the fields of chemistry and materials science. In this blog post, we review two recent contributions leveraging diffusion models for distinct yet related problems: **optimal adsorbate placement** and **data-efficient molecular generation**.

## Adsorbate Placement via Conditional Denoising Diffusion (AbsorbDiff)

### Problem Statement

In heterogeneous catalysis, accurately determining the optimal adsorbate placement on catalytic slabs (adslab configurations) is crucial for discovering effective new catalysts. Traditionally, finding these optimal placements involves:
	-	Initial heuristic or random placement of the adsorbate molecule.
	-	Subsequent optimization with computationally expensive quantum mechanical methods such as **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** to determine the lowest energy configuration.

This conventional approach has significant limitations:
	-	**Computational inefficiency**: Evaluating numerous potential sites individually through DFT is prohibitively expensive.
	-	**Heuristic limitations**: Reliance on heuristics may miss global optima due to insufficient exploration of configuration space.
	-	**Brute-force inefficiencies**: Exhaustively sampling numerous adsorbate configurations is computationally intensive and impractical.

Thus, a more efficient and systematic method for adsorbate placement is critically needed.

### Motivation: What does AdsorbDiff Aim to Tackle?

The **AdsorbDiff** paper introduces a conditional denoising diffusion framework designed explicitly to tackle these limitations. The key motivation behind **AdsorbDiff** is to leverage recent advancements in diffusion-based generative models, which have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and accuracy across various domains, particularly molecular and material sciences.

Specifically, **AdsorbDiff** aims to:
	-	Accurately predict optimal adsorbate sites and orientations.
	-	Significantly reduce the computational overhead of searching for global minima.
	-	Fully utilize existing computational data through conditional training.

This framework capitalizes on recent successes in generative modeling and machine learning force fields (MLFFs) to accelerate catalytic discovery.

### Method Overview

The AdsorbDiff method integrates a novel diffusion-based generative model with ML-driven optimizations in a systematic workflow:

**1. Conditional Diffusion Modeling**
	-	**Translation and Rotation Modeling:**
AdsorbDiff defines a diffusion process over the manifold of 2D translations and 3D rigid rotations of an adsorbate relative to the slab, explicitly considering periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The diffusion model iteratively updates the adsorbate’s position and orientation toward energetically favorable states.
	-	**Conditional Training:**
The diffusion training is conditioned on relative energies (differences from the lowest-energy configurations), significantly enhancing training efficiency and effectiveness compared to naive unconditional training.
	-	**Score Matching and Reverse Diffusion:**
AdsorbDiff employs a score-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model, where the model learns to approximate gradients of the probability density of optimal configurations. This technique allows systematic sampling toward lower-energy states from initially randomized placements.

1. ML Force Field Optimization
	•	After obtaining predictions from the diffusion model, **AdsorbDiff** performs rapid local optimizations using ML force fields trained on large DFT-derived datasets. This step refines the predicted positions, drastically reducing computational costs while maintaining near-DFT accuracy.

1. Final Verification
	•	A single-point DFT verification evaluates the accuracy of optimized configurations, ensuring reliability and consistency with rigorous quantum mechanical benchmarks.

### Experimental Results

Experiments were conducted using the OC20-Dense dataset, extensively benchmarked and widely recognized in computational catalysis research. Key results demonstrating AdsorbDiff’s effectiveness include:
	-	**Improved Success Rate**:
AdsorbDiff achieved a 31.8% success rate in identifying configurations within 0.1 eV of the DFT benchmark, significantly outperforming the naive random baseline (9.1%) and unconditional diffusion baseline (11.4%).
	-	**Efficiency in Computational Cost**:
AdsorbDiff matched the accuracy achieved by baseline methods that required evaluating multiple (5x more) random placements, highlighting substantial computational savings.
	-	**Generalization Capability**:
Evaluations demonstrated robust generalization to unseen adsorbate-slab systems (out-of-distribution scenarios), underscoring the model’s practical utility for novel catalyst discovery tasks.
	-	**Impact of Pre-training and Architecture Choices**:
Experiments confirmed that conditional diffusion significantly benefits from extensive pre-training on diverse local optimization data. Moreover, AdsorbDiff exhibited insensitivity to different GNN architectures during diffusion training, simplifying architecture selection compared to traditional ML force field models.

### Summary of Contributions:

	- Developed **AdsorbDiff**, a novel conditional diffusion framework for efficiently predicting optimal adsorbate placements.
	- Demonstrated substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency over traditional heuristic and brute-force methods.
	- Showed robust generalization and practical viability through rigorous benchmarking on the OC20-Dense dataset.

Overall, **AdsorbDiff** provides an innovative solution addressing longstanding computational bottlenecks in catalytic materials discovery.

## Data-Efficient Molecular Generation with Hierarchical Textual Inversion (HI-Mol)


**HI-Mol** addresses the issue of limited molecular data in practical applications such as drug discovery. It introduces a **hierarchical textual inversion** technique, adapted from the visual domain, to molecular data generation. The method provides:

- **Hierarchical token embeddings** capturing both coarse and fine-grained molecular features.
- **Embedding interpolation** for generating novel molecules from limited training examples.
- Enhanced **data efficiency**, outperforming existing methods substantially even with significantly reduced data.


## Common Themes and Complementary Strengths

Although AdsorbDiff and HI-Mol tackle different problems, they share several critical strengths:

- Both leverage the **robust generative capabilities** of diffusion models.
- Each uses **conditional diffusion** to maximize data utility and computational efficiency.
- They offer meaningful advancements for practical applications in **catalysis** and **pharmaceutical chemistry**.

## Future Directions and Implications

The demonstrated success of both AdsorbDiff and HI-Mol suggests diffusion models have broad applicability in computational chemistry. Future research could explore:

- Developing **integrated frameworks** that combine molecule generation with optimal catalytic surface placement.
- Extending these methods to **more complex chemical and biological systems**.

## Conclusion

The use of diffusion models exemplified by **AdsorbDiff** and **HI-Mol** marks a significant advance, offering efficient and accurate solutions for traditionally challenging computational problems in **chemistry** and **materials science**.
