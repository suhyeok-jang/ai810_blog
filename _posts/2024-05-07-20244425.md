## Introduction

Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention for their powerful generative capabilities, particularly in the fields of chemistry and materials science. In this blog post, we review two recent contributions leveraging diffusion models for distinct yet related problems: **optimal adsorbate placement** and **data-efficient molecular generation**.

## Adsorbate Placement via Conditional Denoising Diffusion (AbsorbDiff)


The paper **AdsorbDiff** introduces a novel conditional denoising diffusion framework to predict optimal adsorbate configurations on catalytic slabs. Determining such configurations typically involves computationally expensive **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** calculations. AdsorbDiff addresses these challenges by:

- Employing **conditional diffusion training** based on relative energy differences.
- Explicitly incorporating **periodic boundary conditions** with 2D translations and 3D rotations.
- Utilizing **ML force field optimization** to quickly identify optimal configurations.

## Data-Efficient Molecular Generation with Hierarchical Textual Inversion (HI-Mol)


**HI-Mol** addresses the issue of limited molecular data in practical applications such as drug discovery. It introduces a **hierarchical textual inversion** technique, adapted from the visual domain, to molecular data generation. The method provides:

- **Hierarchical token embeddings** capturing both coarse and fine-grained molecular features.
- **Embedding interpolation** for generating novel molecules from limited training examples.
- Enhanced **data efficiency**, outperforming existing methods substantially even with significantly reduced data.


## Connecting the Dot - Common Themes and Complementary Strengths

Although AdsorbDiff and HI-Mol tackle different problems, they share several critical strengths:

- Both leverage the **robust generative capabilities** of diffusion models.
- Each uses **conditional diffusion** to maximize data utility and computational efficiency.
- They offer meaningful advancements for practical applications in **catalysis** and **pharmaceutical chemistry**.

## Future Directions and Implications

The demonstrated success of both AdsorbDiff and HI-Mol suggests diffusion models have broad applicability in computational chemistry. Future research could explore:

- Developing **integrated frameworks** that combine molecule generation with optimal catalytic surface placement.
- Extending these methods to **more complex chemical and biological systems**.

## Conclusion

The use of diffusion models exemplified by **AdsorbDiff** and **HI-Mol** marks a significant advance, offering efficient and accurate solutions for traditionally challenging computational problems in **chemistry** and **materials science**.
